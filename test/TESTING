Testing
==============

Tests are written with Shoulda on top of Test::Unit and Factory Girl is used instead of fixtures. Tests are run using rake.

MySQL
=======

1. Create a new Rails app.
2. Install acts_as_sortable as a plugin.
3. Copy the database config within the plugin:
    cp test/database.yml.example test/database.yml
4. Create a database as specified in test/database.yml.
5. Run the tests:
    rake test


Coverage
=======

Test coverage can be calculated using Rcov. Make sure you have the rcov gem installed.

Again in the acts_as_sortable directory:

rake rcov:gen   # For mysql

The coverage will now be available in the test/coverage directory.

rake rcov:clobber will delete the coverage directory.
